title: "Add-On Packages"

When you install R, you're only installing the core set of functionality. You can already do quite a lot with this
baseline R installation (e.g., a complete linear regression analysis), but you will usually need functionality provided
by add-on *packages* to complete most real-world data analyses.

For example, the following list shows some common analyses for which you would typically use add-on packages (and some
suitable packages).

- Treating missing data using multiple imputation
  - [mice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/index.html)
  - [Amelia](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Amelia/index.html)
  - [mi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mi/index.html)
- Structural equation modeling
  - [lavaan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan/index.html)
  - [OpenMx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenMx/index.html)
- Multilevel regression modeling
  - [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html)
  - [nlme](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html)
- For all but the most trivial data processing, manipulation, and visualization, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
packages are virtually obligatory.
