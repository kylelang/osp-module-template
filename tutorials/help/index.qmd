title: "Package Documentation"

Every R function provided by a Core R package or an add-on package distributed through CRAN must come with documentation
(AKA, a help file). This documentation always follows the same general structure. Below, you see the documentation for 
the `arrange()` function from the **dplyr** package.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(printr)
?dplyr::arrange
```
