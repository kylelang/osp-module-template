Question
========
Which of the following options represent R function calls?

Answerlist
----------
* `rnorm(n = 100)`
* `mean(x, trim = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)`
* `.libPaths()`
* `"foo"`
* `bar`
* `y`
* `TRUE`
* `3.14159`
* `Inf`
* `NA`

Solution
========
You can recognize a valid function call by the pattern: `FUNCTION_NAME()`.

Answerlist
----------
* Correct. This function call would generate 100 random standard normal deviates.
* Correct. This function call would calculate the trimmed mean of `x`, ignoring any missing values.
* Correct. This function call will list the library paths where R will install packages on your system.
* This is a length-one character vector.
* This is a symbol (i.e., the name of an object).
* This is a symbol (i.e., the name of an object).
* This is a length-one logical vector.
* This is a length-one numeric vector.
* This is R's infinite value code.
* This is R's missing value code.
